This is a collection of non-dotfile configuration files.

## windows-terminal-settings.json

This is the settings file for the new [Windows Terminal][win-terminal].
Settings syunc was disabled as the settings are still pretty host-specific.
Copy the settings file to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_[random ID]\LocalState\settings.json`
(do Win-R, then copy paste up through `Packages` in the above path).

	### Pasteboard Access ##
	# macOS spoiled me with easy access to `pbcopy` and `pbpaste`. They're
	# super simple commands, and basically the only flags they have are very
	# rarely used. The linux alternatives on the other hand are not as simple
	# to use. These aliases wrap the linux alternatives up so they're as simple
	# to use as `pbcopy` and `pbpaste`.

			alias pbcopy='xclip -i -selection clipboard'
			alias pbpaste='xclip -o -selection clipboard'

	### Mouse Reporting Reset ###
	# A quick alias to print the control sequence to disable mouse position
	# reporting. An example of when this is useful is when tmux doesn't disable
	# it when being closed. If there's a spew of garbage when clicking,
	# dragging, etc, run this alias to disable it. iTerm2 can disable it with a
	# menu item, but this is a bit quicker, and also works on things other than
	# iTerm (for example, Windows Terminal)
	alias resetmouse='printf "\e[?1000l"'
